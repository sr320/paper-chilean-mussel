    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Methylation Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Hypermethylation** (positive values): 60% of DMLs\n",
    "-   **Hypomethylation** (negative values): 40% of DMLs\n",
    "-   Range: -77.0% to +69.6% methylation difference\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Gene Clusters**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Some genes contain multiple DMLs (e.g., MCH000252.1, MCH005662.1, MCH008986.1)\n",
    "-   Chromosome_3 has the highest concentration of genes with DMLs\n",
    "-   Chromosome_9 is missing due to GFF3 annotation typo\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Biological Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Genes with DMLs may have altered expression patterns\n",
    "-   Methylation changes in gene bodies could affect transcription or splicing\n",
    "-   These genes represent potential targets for functional studies\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files Generated\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`genes_with_dmls.tsv`** - Detailed DML-gene associations with methylation data\n",
    "2.  **`genes_with_dmls_simple_list.tsv`** - Simple list of unique genes with DMLs\n",
    "3.  **`Genes_with_DMLs_Summary.md`** - This comprehensive summary report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Functional validation** of genes with extreme methylation changes\n",
    "2.  **Expression analysis** to correlate methylation with gene expression\n",
    "3.  **Pathway analysis** to identify functional categories of affected genes\n",
    "4.  **Fix GFF3 annotation** for Chromosome_9 to include missing genes\n",
    "5.  **Comparative analysis** with other mussel species for evolutionary insights"
