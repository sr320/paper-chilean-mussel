      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Understanding how marine species respond to environmental
  heterogeneity is critical for conserving locally adapted populations
  and sustaining aquaculture practices in the face of global change. The
  Chilean blue mussel, Mytilus chilensis, a key endemic species in
  southern Chile, supports one of the world’s largest mussel aquaculture
  industries. However, the biological foundation of population-level
  adaptation in this species remains underexplored. Emerging evidence
  suggests that both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms—particularly DNA
  methylation—may contribute to phenotypic plasticity and local
  adaptation in marine invertebrates.</p>
      <p>Previous studies have revealed extensive transcriptomic and
  mitochondrial differences between M. chilensis populations from
  ecologically distinct seedbeds, such as Cochamó (41°S) and Yaldad
  (43°S), in the inner sea of Chiloé Island. These differences include
  differential expression of genes involved in immunity, metabolism, and
  cellular stress responses, as well as tissue-specific shifts in
  mitochondrial gene expression linked to local environmental pressures,
  including aquaculture practices and variable oxygenation levels
  [@yevenes2021adaptive; @yevenes2022adaptive]. Experimental evidence
  from reciprocal transplants shows population-specific transcriptional
  responses and reduced growth performance upon translocation,
  highlighting functional divergence between seedbeds despite high
  larval connectivity [@yevenes2025decoding].</p>
      <p>In addition to gene expression differences, recent work has
  uncovered epigenetic signatures that may contribute to adaptive
  divergence. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were found to be
  differentially expressed between Cochamó and Yaldad populations, with
  associated changes in immune and metabolic gene networks
  [@yevenes2023epigenetic]. These findings underscore the potential for
  environmentally responsive regulatory elements—including DNA
  methylation—to mediate local adaptation.</p>
      <p>Yet, the role of DNA methylation in shaping population-specific
  responses in M. chilensis remains unexplored. DNA methylation, a
  heritable and reversible epigenetic modification, can influence gene
  expression and phenotypic traits without altering the underlying DNA
  sequence. In bivalves, DNA methylation is known to affect
  developmental and immune processes and may be responsive to
  environmental stressors such as hypoxia, toxins, and
  acidification—conditions that vary across the Chilean inner sea and
  have been shown to modulate gene expression and microbiota composition
  in M. chilensis [@montufar2024hypoxia; @castillo2017ocean;
  @montufar2025microbiota].</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigate genome-wide DNA methylation patterns
  in Mytilus chilensis from two contrasting seedbeds—Cochamó and
  Yaldad—with the aim of identifying differentially methylated regions
  (DMRs) that may underlie local adaptation. By integrating this
  epigenetic information with known patterns of gene expression and
  environmental context, we seek to illuminate the molecular basis of
  ecological divergence and contribute new insights into how
  environmental and anthropogenic forces shape genomic and epigenomic
  variation in a key aquaculture species.</p>

        <title>Methods</title>
        <p>To investigate DNA methylation differences between populations of
    Mytilus chilensis from Cochamó and Yaldad, whole-genome bisulfite
    sequencing (WGBS) was performed and analyzed using a reproducible,
    high-throughput bioinformatics workflow. DNA was extracted from gill
    tissue of adult individuals and subjected to bisulfite treatment and
    library preparation. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq
    6000 platform, generating 150 bp paired-end reads, with each sample
    yielding approximately 120–160 million read pairs, providing &gt;30×
    average coverage across the 1.93 Gb M. chilensis genome.</p>
        <sec id="read-processing-and-alignment">
          <title>Read Processing and Alignment</title>
          <p>Raw sequencing reads were processed using the nf-core/methylseq
      pipeline (version 2.5), implemented through Nextflow (version
      23.04.1). Reads were aligned to the M. chilensis reference genome
      (MchilensisGenomeV1.fa), a chromosome-level assembly comprising 14
      scaffolds (Gallardo-Escárate et al. 2023), using Bismark (version
      0.24.1) with the Bowtie2 aligner (version 2.5.1). Quality trimming
      was applied to reverse reads by hard-clipping the final 10 bases
      (–clip_r2 10) to mitigate low-quality base calls at the 3′ end.
      Methylation calls were extracted using the Bismark methylation
      extractor and aggregated by cytosine context. Pipeline execution
      was configured via a custom .config file to specify HPC resources
      and run with –resume, –with-trace, –with-report, and
      –with-timeline flags for reproducibility and tracking. Output
      files were stored in a structured directory and included per-base
      CpG methylation calls, quality control metrics, and coverage
      files.</p>

        <sec id="methylation-data-processing-and-filtering">
          <title>Methylation Data Processing and Filtering</title>
          <p>Downstream analysis was performed in R (version 4.3.1) using
      the methylKit package (version 1.10.0). Due to compatibility
      issues with newer versions of supporting libraries, data.table was
      pinned to version 1.14.10. Methylation coverage files were
      imported using methRead() with the pipeline = “bismarkCoverage”
      parameter and CpG context specified. Six samples—three each from
      Cochamó (LCo_BSr1–3) and Yaldad (LYa_BSr1–3)—were analyzed.
      Samples were assigned to treatment groups with Cochamó designated
      as the control (treatment = 0) and Yaldad as the treatment group
      (treatment = 1).</p>
          <p>To ensure data quality, CpG sites were filtered to retain only
      those with a minimum read coverage of 10 in all samples, excluding
      those in the top 2% of coverage values to reduce PCR bias. Sites
      were then unified across samples using unite() with min.per.group
      = 3 and destrand = FALSE to retain strand-specific methylation
      information.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="exploratory-and-differential-methylation-analyses">
          <title>Exploratory and Differential Methylation Analyses</title>
          <p>Global methylation patterns were assessed using hierarchical
      clustering (Ward’s method on correlation distance) and principal
      component analysis (PCA) to evaluate sample similarity.
      Population-level differences in DNA methylation were then tested
      using methylKit’s logistic regression model, incorporating a
      multinomial overdispersion correction (overdispersion = “MN”) to
      account for biological variability. Statistical testing was
      performed using the Chi-squared test (test = “Chisq”), and
      q-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the SLIM method
      (adjust = “SLIM”).</p>
          <p>Differentially methylated loci (DMLs) were defined as CpG sites
      with an absolute methylation difference ≥25% and FDR-adjusted
      q-value ≤ 0.05. Separate sets of DMLs were extracted to identify
      hypomethylated (lower in Yaldad) and hypermethylated (higher in
      Yaldad) loci. Results were saved as tab-delimited text files for
      downstream annotation and visualization.</p>
