Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, generating 150 bp paired-end reads, with each sample yielding approximately 120–160 million read pairs, providing >30× average coverage across the 1.93 Gb M. chilensis genome.\n\n### Read Processing and Alignment\n\nRaw sequencing reads were processed using the nf-core/methylseq pipeline (version 2.5), implemented through Nextflow (version 23.04.1). Reads were aligned to the M. chilensis reference genome (MchilensisGenomeV1.fa), a chromosome-level assembly comprising 14 scaffolds (Gallardo-Escárate et al. 2023), using Bismark (version 0.24.1) with the Bowtie2 aligner (version 2.5.1). Quality trimming was applied to reverse reads by hard-clipping the final 10 bases (--clip_r2 10) to mitigate low-quality base calls at the 3′ end. Methylation calls were extracted using the Bismark methylation extractor and aggregated by cytosine context. Pipeline execution was configured via a custom .config file to specify HPC resources and run with --resume, --with-trace, --with-report, and --with-timeline flags for reproducibility and tracking. Output files were stored in a structured directory and included per-base CpG methylation calls, quality control metrics, and coverage files.\n\n### Methylation Data Processing and Filtering\n\nDownstream analysis was performed in R (version 4.3.1) using the methylKit package (version 1.10.0). Due to compatibility issues with newer versions of supporting libraries, data.table was pinned to version 1.14.10. Methylation coverage files were imported using methRead() with the pipeline = \"bismarkCoverage\" parameter and CpG context specified. Six samples—three each from Cochamó (LCo_BSr1–3) and Yaldad (LYa_BSr1–3)—were analyzed. Samples were assigned to treatment groups with Cochamó designated as the control (treatment = 0) and Yaldad as the treatment group (treatment = 1).\n\nTo ensure data quality, CpG sites were filtered to retain only those with a minimum read coverage of 10 in all samples, excluding those in the top 2% of coverage values to reduce PCR bias. Sites were then unified across samples using unite() with min.per.group = 3 and destrand = FALSE to retain strand-specific methylation information.\n\n### Exploratory and Differential Methylation Analyses\n\nGlobal methylation patterns were assessed using hierarchical clustering (Ward’s method on correlation distance) and principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate sample similarity. Population-level differences in DNA methylation were then tested using methylKit’s logistic regression model, incorporating a multinomial overdispersion correction (overdispersion = \"MN\") to account for biological variability.
